# üî± About me 
‚öúÔ∏èI am a passionate and motivated iOS developer with experience in building apps using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. I enjoy crafting user-friendly and functional applications while continuously improving my coding skills and exploring new technologies.

üîÜCurrently, I am focused on creating innovative projects to enhance my portfolio and demonstrate my abilities to potential employers. My goal is to work as part of a dynamic team, contribute to impactful projects, and eventually grow into a senior developer role.

# My Background
Before specializing in iOS development, I explored various programming languages and technologies, including:

__

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-9EA3DB?style-for-the-badge&logo=Java)

Java: Learned basic syntax and object-oriented programming concepts. Although some time has passed, I believe I could quickly refresh this knowledge if needed.

__

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-090909?style-for-the-badge&logo=JavaScript)
![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-090909?style-for-the-badge&logo=CSS)
![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-090909?style-for-the-badge&logo=HTML)

JavaScript: Developed small web applications and interactive elements.

HTML & CSS: Practiced creating responsive designs and web layouts.
